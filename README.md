### 1. [MissingInteger](https://app.codility.com/demo/take-sample-test/) from [Codility](https://www.codility.com/) - codility_demo_test.cpp.
Find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a given sequence.

### 2. [Small enough?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57cc981a58da9e302a000214) from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - small_enough.cpp.
You will be given an array and a limit value. You must check that all values in the array are below or equal to the limit value. If they are, return true. Else, return false.
You can assume all values in the array are numbers.

### 3. [Life, the Universe, and Everything](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TEST/) from [SPOJ](https://pl.spoj.com/) - life_universe_everything.cpp.
Your program is to use the brute-force approach in order to find the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. More precisely... rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.

### 4. [Roman Numerals Decoder](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51b6249c4612257ac0000005/train/cpp) from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - RomanNumeralsDecoder.cpp.
